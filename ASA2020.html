	 				<div>
	 					<p class = "bigdiff"> Both the <span class = bluetext> amount of variability </span> in the distribution of each labeled category and the <span class = bluetext> distance between category means</span>/the distance between the distributions is likely to affect the fitting of a logistic regression model to data. There was some concern that the relationship between variability and contrast shown in this analysis could be confounded if there was a relationship between variability and the distance between category means. </p>
	 					<p class = "bigdiff"> </p>
	 					<p class = "bigdiff normdiff"> To determine whether this confound was a potential issue in the analysis, for each dimension in each segment pair, the <span class = "bluetext"> distance between the category means </span> was measured and compared to a <span class = "bluetext"> pooled variability measurement </span> for the segments in the pair (calculated by centering the data for each segment, combining the centered data, and calculating the IQR of the combined data)
	 					<p class = "bigdiff"> </p>
	 					<p class = "bigdiff"> The results of this analysis for the articulatory data (analysis of the acoustic data still to be completed) are given in the table below ('COR' in cell = significant correlation between IQR and mean difference for that dimension in that segment comparison). For the majority of the measured dimensions, the calculated IQR values were not correlated with the distance between means. </p>
	 					<p class = "bigdiff"> </p>
	 					<p class = "bigdiff"> To further determine the extent to which the relationship between variability and regression coefficients exists independent of the distance between means, multiple regression models were fit with the distance between means and IQR as predictors and the logistic regression coefficients as the response variable. These models generally found that IQR was still a significant predictor of coefficient values even when taking the distance between means into account - this is shown in the table below, where green cells indicate IQR was a significant predictor in the regression model for the analysis indicated by the cell.</p>
