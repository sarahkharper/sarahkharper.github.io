						Welcome! I am a postdoctoral scholar in the <a href = "https://changlab.ucsf.edu" target="_blank">Chang Lab</a> at UCSF. I received my PhD in <a href = "//https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/" target="_blank">Linguistics</a> from the University of Southern California in Fall 2021, and did my undergraduate work in Spanish and Linguistics at the <a href = "https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics" target="_blank"> University of Michigan</a>.

					<p class = "bigdiff"> My research uses experimental and computational methods to examine systems governing speech production and perception. Specifically, my focus is on  understanding of the nature of the cognitive and neural representations of the structural units underlying these behaviors. <!--My dissertation research examined how patterns of inter- and intraspeaker variability in speech articulation, acoustic, and perception could be used to test and expand upon existing models of phonological cognition. My current work as a postdoc is focused on understanding the neural encoding and behavioral correlates of higher-level structure in speech production.-->

						At USC, I was a member of the <a href = "http://sail.usc.edu/span/index.html" target="_blank">Speech Articulation and Knowledge Group (SPAN)</a> and the <a href = "http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~dbyrd/index.html" target="_blank">USC Phonetics and Phonology group</a>. <!--and the <a href = "http://zevinlab.org/" target="_blank">Zevin Lab</a>.--> I was also a pre-doctoral fellow in the interdisciplinary <a href = "https://dornsife.usc.edu/hcn/" target="_blank">Hearing and Communication Neuroscience</a> training program from 2018-2020.

						When I'm not working, I enjoy running, hiking, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. In the pre-pandemic times, I competed in ballroom dancing with the <a href = "http://www.uscballroom.org/home/" target="_blank">SC Ballroom and Latin Dance Team</a>.
