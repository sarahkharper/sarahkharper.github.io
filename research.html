					The primary aim of my research is to use variation in speech production and perception to improve our understanding of the cognitive and biomechanical systems involved in speech communication. My current work focuses specifically on determining whether and when interspeaker differences in the perception and production of phonemes suggest that speakers differ in their cognitive representations of phonological units, and what the functional consequences of these differences may be for communication and language learning.
