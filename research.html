					My research examines interspeaker variation in speech production and perception, with the aim of using variation to better understand the cognitive and biomechanical systems that guide communication. Most of my work addresses (either directly or indirectly) the question of whether and when interspeaker differences in the perception and production of phonemes suggest that speakers differ in their cognitive representations of (sub-)phonemic units, and what the functional consequences of these differences may be for communication and language learning.
