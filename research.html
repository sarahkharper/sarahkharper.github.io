					 My first screening paper focused on modeling the relationship between F3 values and aperture for the labial, palatal, and pharyngeal constrictions in /r/ production. Using rtMRI data from the <a href="http://sail.usc.edu/span/usc-timit/index.html" target = "_blank"> USC TIMIT Corpus </a>, we found that individual speakers differ in the relative contribution of the palatal and pharyngeal constriction gestures to the acoustic signal, with the relative importance of each to F3 lowering dependent on the location and length of each gesture within the vocal tract.

					 In a follow-up experiment comparing acoustic and articulatory data from read sentences in the USC Timit Corpus to words produced in isolation in another rtMRI experiment, we observed that the more formal speech style
